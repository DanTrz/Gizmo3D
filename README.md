# Gizmo3D

Gizmo aims to encapsulate the Godot Engines 3D move/scale/rotation gizmos into a customizable node, with some differences. Namely, the ability to edit all transformations at the same time and only one node can be edited at a time.

## Licensing
Gizmo3D is a C# port of C++ code from the Godot Engine source. Gizmo3D is licensed under MIT, while the license for the Godot Engine can be found [here](https://godotengine.org/license/).

## Assets
