# Gizmo3D

Gizmo3D aims to encapsulate the Godot Engines 3D move/scale/rotation gizmos into a customizable node for use at runtime. There are some differences - namely, the ability to edit all transformations at the same time and only one node can be edited at a time. The selection box and axes can be toggled, colors changed, snapping intervals customized, and more. It is available in both C# and GDScript.
