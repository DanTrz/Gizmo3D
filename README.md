# Gizmo3D

Gizmo3D aims to encapsulate the Godot Engines 3D move/scale/rotation gizmos into a customizable node, with some differences. Namely, the ability to edit all transformations at the same time and only one node can be edited at a time.

### Installation
Copy either Gizmo3DScript or Gizmo3DSharp from the addons folder into the addons folder of your project. Read more about installing and enabling addons [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).

### Licensing
Gizmo3D is a C# and GDScript port of C++ code from the Godot Engine source. Gizmo3D is licensed under MIT, while the license for the Godot Engine can be found [here](https://godotengine.org/license/).

### Assets
The demo project uses assets from Kenny's [Mini Dungeon](https://kenney.nl/assets/mini-dungeon) asset pack.
